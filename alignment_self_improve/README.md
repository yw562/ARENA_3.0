# Measuring Alignment Under Self-Improvement

This repository implements a **minimal, modular, and reproducible** pipeline
to study how **capability and alignment metrics evolve under iterative self-improvement**.

The core research question is:

> When models improve their own capabilities through self-generated data,
> does alignment (e.g. refusal behavior) degrade?

This project is designed as an ARENA capstone and a potential submission to
the RSI / Recursive workshop (ICLR).

## High-level Design

Each experiment consists of **iterations**.
Iteration 0 is always a **baseline evaluation** (no training).

For iteration `k > 0`, the pipeline runs:

1. **Generate** self-produced solutions on GSM8K
2. **Filter** correct solutions (exact-match final answer)
3. **Train** via LoRA (using Tinker API)
4. **Evaluate**
   - Capability: GSM8K exact match
   - Alignment: refusal rate on AdvBench-style prompts

All artifacts are written to disk to ensure auditability.

## Reproducibility Guarantees

The pipeline is designed so that:

- **Evaluation metrics are independent of model execution**
- Metrics can be validated using fake outputs (see below)
- All configs are snapshotted into the results directory
- Raw model outputs are saved for auditability

---

## Setup

```bash
cd alignment_self_improve
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or use arena-env
export TINKER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

Running an Experiment
Iteration 0 (baseline evaluation only)
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/run_experiment.py \
  --config configs/instruct.yaml


This will:

Evaluate the base (instruct) model

Write metrics and raw outputs

Not run self-improvement if num_iterations: 0

Validating the Evaluation Pipeline (No Model Required)
GSM8K Capability Metric
PYTHONPATH=src python

from asi.eval_capability import eval_gsm8k_exact_match
from asi.data import load_gsm8k, parse_gsm8k_final_answer

gsm = load_gsm8k("test", limit=3)
correct = parse_gsm8k_final_answer(gsm[0].answer)

fake_outputs = [
    f"#### {correct}",  # correct
    "#### 999",         # incorrect
    "I don't know"      # incorrect
]

res = eval_gsm8k_exact_match(gsm, fake_outputs)
print(res)


Expected: accuracy ≈ 0.33

Refusal Metric
from asi.eval_safety import eval_refusal_rate

fake = [
  "I cannot help with that request.",
  "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with this.",
  "Sure, here is how you do it..."
]

print(eval_refusal_rate(fake))


Expected: refusal_rate ≈ 0.66

Notes

Backend capacity (Tinker) may temporarily pause model creation.

All evaluation logic can be tested independently of model availability.

Iteration >0 enables self-improvement via LoRA.
